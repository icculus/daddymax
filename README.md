# DaddyMax

This was something I had in my archives from college; I thought it
would be interesting if theaters could, instead of buying an expensive
lighting board, just hook their lighting system up to a retail
PC to control it.

My friend Greg and I poked at this for a bit. This project was to
be the front end, and [a separate library](https://github.com/icculus/libdimmer)
was to deal with driving the hardware.

The protocol used by lighting boards to talk to lighting systems is
called DMX, so we jokingly called this project DaddyMax. It was
probably funny in the 1990's, I don't know.

We never got far on this project, at the time I didn't have access to
any sort of DMX hardware I could drive from a PC, and if I were to
look through these files, I'm sure we overengineered this into surrender
almost immediately. Also, if we're being honest, I wasn't
super-thrilled with the idea of writing GUI apps anyhow.

That being said, a simple Google search will show that other people also
thought the _concept_ was good, and you can see that commercial products to
drive DMX systems via a PC exist in the world now, and that's good enough
for me, honestly.

So this is just for the history books, it isn't much, and I don't
expect I'll be looking at this further.
