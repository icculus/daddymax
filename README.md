# DaddyMax

This was something I had in my archives from college; I thought it
would be interesting if theaters could, instead of buying an expensive
lighting board, just hook their lighting system up to a retail
PC to control it.

The protocol used by lighting boards to talk to lighting systems is
called DMX, so I jokingly called this project DaddyMax. It was
probably funny in the 1990's, I don't know.

I never got far on this project, at the time I didn't have access to
any sort of DMX hardware I could drive from a PC, and if I were to
look through these files, I'm sure I overengineered this into surrender
almost immediately. Also, if we're being honest, I wasn't
super-thrilled with the idea of writing GUI apps anyhow.

So this is just for the history books, it isn't much, and I don't
expect I'll be looking at this further.
